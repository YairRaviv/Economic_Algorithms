# Economic Algorithms Repository

This repository contains a consolidated collection of assignments, projects, and learning materials from my Economic Algorithms coursework at Ariel University.

## Overview

Economic Algorithms is a field that combines economics, game theory, and computer science to design and analyze algorithms for economic scenarios. This repository includes implementations of various economic algorithms, mathematical proofs, and solutions to complex economic problems.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by assignment topics:

- **Assignment 2**: Fair division algorithms and leximin comparison
- **Assignment 5**: Envy-free allocations and fair division concepts
- **Assignment 7**: Resource allocation algorithms
- **Assignment 10**: Nash welfare optimization for budget allocation
- **Assignment 11**: Mechanism design implementations
- **Assignment 12**: Auction theory and simulations

## Key Topics Covered

- **Fair Division Algorithms**: Methods for dividing resources fairly among participants
- **Matching Algorithms**: Solutions for optimal matching problems (e.g., stable matching)
- **Game Theory**: Strategic decision-making and equilibrium concepts
- **Auction Theory**: Different auction formats and their properties
- **Mechanism Design**: Creating systems that align incentives with desired outcomes
- **Social Choice Theory**: Aggregating individual preferences into collective decisions

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Primary programming language for algorithm implementation
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For analysis and visualization
- **NumPy/SciPy**: For mathematical operations and simulations
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization
