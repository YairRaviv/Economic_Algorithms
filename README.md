# Economic Algorithms Repository

This repository contains a consolidated collection of assignments, projects, and learning materials from my Economic Algorithms coursework at Ariel University.

## Overview

Economic Algorithms is a field that combines economics, game theory, and computer science to design and analyze algorithms for economic scenarios. This repository includes implementations of various economic algorithms, mathematical proofs, and solutions to complex economic problems.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by assignment topics:

- **Assignment_2**: Fair division algorithms and leximin comparison
- **Assignment_3**: Advanced fair division techniques
- **Assignment_5**: Envy-free allocations and fair division concepts
- **Assignment_7**: Resource allocation algorithms
- **Assignment_10**: Nash welfare optimization for budget allocation
- **Assignment_11**: Mechanism design implementations
- **Assignment_12**: Auction theory and simulations

## Key Topics Covered

- **Fair Division Algorithms**: Methods for dividing resources fairly among participants
- **Matching Algorithms**: Solutions for optimal matching problems (e.g., stable matching)
- **Game Theory**: Strategic decision-making and equilibrium concepts
- **Auction Theory**: Different auction formats and their properties
- **Mechanism Design**: Creating systems that align incentives with desired outcomes
- **Social Choice Theory**: Aggregating individual preferences into collective decisions

## Assignment Details

### Assignment 2: Fair Division and Leximin Comparison
Implementations of leximin ordering for comparing allocations and algorithms for finding almost envy-free allocations.

### Assignment 3: Advanced Fair Division

### Assignment 7: Resource Allocation Algorithms
Implementation of different choice rules and threshold-based payment mechanisms.

### Assignment 10: Nash Welfare Optimization
Algorithms for optimizing Nash welfare in budget allocation problems using convex optimization.

### Assignment 11: Mechanism Design
