# Assignment 3: Advanced Fair Division

This assignment focuses on advanced fair division algorithms and their implementations.

## Contents

- **findAlmostEnvyFree.py**: Implementation of an algorithm to find almost envy-free allocations

## Key Concepts

- Advanced envy-free allocation algorithms
- Fair division techniques
- Resource allocation methods

## Implementation Details

The main algorithms in this assignment implement processes for finding fair allocations that minimize envy between agents, with particular focus on more advanced techniques than those covered in Assignment 2.
